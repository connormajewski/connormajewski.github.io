					<h1><a href="https://github.com/connormajewski/ModelManager" target="blank">ModelManager↗</a></h1>
					<h2><i>Python, SQL</i></h2>
				
					<p id="Model-Text">
						I recently built a desktop application to manage a collection of over 4,000 scale models. I spent a week at the location collecting data using a Python program I wrote, which uses the <b><a href="https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT">RealTimeSST↗</a></b> and <b><a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">OpenPyXL↗</a></b> libraries to send a basic transcription of model information to an Excel spreadsheet. After collecting the rudimentary data, I spent the next couple of weeks cleaning it, again using OpenPyXL to automatically clean and update the spreadsheet. To find the estimated value of each model, I originally wrote a program to scrape eBay, find the closest matches and average their cost, but ran into issues with similar items having wildly different names. </br></br> Once all the data was cleaned, I used <b>sqlite3</b> to convert the spreadsheet into a database file. I used <b><a href="https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/">customTkinter↗</a></b> to design a GUI frontend that allows a user to easily perform CRUD commands. Models can be searched, filtered, updated, added, and deleted, and results can be sent to an Excel file for future use. </br></br> I then started working on connecting the program to eBay. I wrote a basic helper library that would allow me to make calls to eBay, using a mix of the RESTful and Trading APIs. When listing a model for sale inside the program, all that is needed is the dimensions, weight, and at least one image. Shipping costs are automatically calculated when creating the listing. The biggest bottleneck to this was having to upload images. I am calling eBay Picture Service when images are uploaded, which works, but is very slow.

					<h1><a href="https://github.com/connormajewski/SDL2-Mock-Inspector" target="blank">Shape Inspector↗</a></h1>
					<h2><i>C++</i></h2>
					
					
					<p id="Shape-Text">
						I used the <b><a href=”https://www.libsdl.org/”>SDL2↗</a></b> library to create a shape inspector tool to become more familiar with C++ and basic graphics programming. I created a couple of basic shapes, and then added functions to display the shape to the screen. I then synced the rotation of shapes to mouse movement, so that moving the mouse up, down, left, and right rotates the shape in the same direction. The program can also plot arbitrary points from a given list.

					<h2><i>HTML\CSS, JavaScript, Python</i></h2>
					
					<p id="Song-Text">
						I started this project because I wanted a simple basic demo of an idea I had. I wanted to make a simple site where users can add and retrieve song links on YouTube through a site-wide playlist of sorts. I used the YouTube v3 API with Python for song searching, <b>sqlite</b> for storing and retrieving song links, and <b><a href=”https://www.djangoproject.com/”>Django↗</a></b> for overall website structure and content handling.

					<p id="Bass-Text">
						I’ve been playing bass for a couple of years now, and a year ago, I started a YouTube channel as a hobby to post bass line transcriptions in order to improve my listening and playing skills. I ended up learning a lot more than I ever thought possible. I learned how to create transcriptions using MuseScore, the basics of audio and video editing using Davinci Resolve, and thumbnail creation using Photoshop. Now, a year later, I feel like I am a much better player for it. Most of the time, I’ll just be listening to a song online and decide to learn it. </br></br> I have posted over 30 videos so far, and have no plans to stop. I am also learning to play guitar, and my hope is that I’ll be at a good enough level someday to start doing guitar transcriptions as well.
