						Hi, my name is Connor Majewski.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I'm a computer science graduate currently looking for work.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This site is a way for me to showcase some of the projects and hobbies I have worked on.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I hope you enjoy.

					<h1><a href="https://github.com/connormajewski/ModelManager" target="blank">ModelManager</a></h1>
				
					<p id="Model-Text">
						I recently built a desktop application to manage a collection of over 4,000 scale models. 
						I spent weeks collecting information on each model before turning everything into a functional database. 
						I then used the Ebay API to connect the app to a user's account to create listings.
